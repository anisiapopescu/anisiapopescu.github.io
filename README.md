## Liquid consonants: the gateway between vowels and consonants

The project investigates the behavior of coda liquid consonants from both a production
and a representational standpoint. From a production standpoint, coda liquids exhibit coordination patterns reserved for onsets.
From a representation standpoint, native speakers attribute variable syllable count judgments
to monosyllabic words involving a tense vowel/diphthong followed by a liquid (e.g., feel, fear, file, fire). A unified account
of liquids consonants integrating both quantitative and qualitative elements is provided.

## Using Speech Technology to test phonological theories
In this project we use speech technology derived methodologies to investigate phonetic variation and sound change in large speech corpora. 


## Language acquisition 

This project investigates the relationship between reading acquisition and coarticulatory organization, a fundamental correlate of spoken language fluency,
in preliterate and beginning readers of German, a language which supports rather consistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships. 
Results show that higher levels of phonological awareness more proficient readers exhibit lower degrees of anticipatory coarticulation in CV sequences.
