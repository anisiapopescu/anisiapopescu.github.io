## Liquid consonants: the gateway between vowels and consonants

The project investigates the behavior of coda liquid consonants from both a production and a representational standpoint.

**Articulation of lateral consonants**
This study investigates whether tongue narrowing correlates over time with the unfolding coronal and uvular constriction in English laterals, using multi-slice rtMRI imaging (mid-saggital and axial slices). [abstract](Popescu_etal2022_Labphon18.pdf)

**Gestural timing in rimes involving liquid consonants**
In American English rimes involving liquids exhibit coordination patterns reserved for onsets. One explanation for this divergent behavior is the complex gestural composition of the coda liquids. The present paper investigates the relationship between lateral consonant darkness and coda coordination patterns in Georgian, Romanian, Russian and American English. (submitted)

**A gestural account of sesquisyllables** 
Sesquisyllables - words involving tense vowels or diphthongs followed by a liquid consonant (feel, file, pier, pyre) - receive variable syllable count judgments (non monosyllabic) from native speakers. This project investigates the reasons behind the variation in syllable weight perception and the hypothesis that syllable count judgments are related to subsegmental representations in the rime, and in particular to the gestural specification of coda liquids.

## Using Speech Technology to test phonological theories
In this project we use speech technology derived methodologies (forced alignment with pronunciation variants, running multiple language acoustic models in parallel) to investigate phonetic variation and sound change in large speech corpora. 

**Lenition and Fortition**
This study investigates whether place of articulation plays a role in stop devoicing in five Romance languages using large
corpora and automatic alignment with pronunciation variants. [Popescu et al., 2023](Popescu_etal_ICPhS2023.pdf)

**Phonetic typology**
The present study tests whether voicing in Europeant Portuguese (EP) fricatives diverges from its sister languages by using empirically motivated combinations of different languages
(EP, Italian, German) acoustic phone models on large EP corpora, allowing an ASR system to choose the best fitting one when force aligning the data. [prerpint Popescu, Lamel & Vasilescu, 2023](Popescu_Lamel_Vasilescu_ICNLSP2023.pdf)


## Language acquisition 

This project investigates the relationship between reading acquisition and coarticulatory organization, a fundamental correlate of spoken language fluency,
in preliterate and beginning readers of German, a language which supports consistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships. 
Results show that higher levels of phonological awareness, larger vocabulary and better reading skill are correlated with lower degrees of anticipatory coarticulation in CV sequences.
