    <p>This project investigates the relationship between reading acquisition and coarticulatory organization, a fundamental correlate of spoken language fluency,
in preliterate and beginning readers of German, a language which supports consistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships. 
Results show that higher levels of phonological awareness, larger vocabulary and better reading skill are correlated with lower degrees of anticipatory coarticulation in CV sequences.
